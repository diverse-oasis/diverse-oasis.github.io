We offer self check-in anytime after 3pm. Upon arrival at
[814 Artie Rd. NW (off of Alameda)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y9g79SAFpjQDCsmA9),
enter through the iron gate with a "Nadja Suite" address sign into
your private courtyard. It has a slide bolt without a lock to open. It
is just past the log with the address 814 Artie on it and next to the
"Guest Parking" sign. I'd suggest parking right in front of the gate
as the property is on a very quiet cul-de-sac and it is slightly
off-street, but you can park anywhere that doesn't block the garage or
driveway gate. If you have precious cargo and want to park in the
garage, I can often arrange for that as well.

The door code and WiFi are in your check-in information near check-in
time. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any trouble!
